# Virtual Assistant that inte Virtual que interage com o usuario mudando os estados da aplicaÃ§ao Web - como construir um?


Imagine that you are looking for a product "X" (or some specific information) on a random website which your cant find it. 

The website has a ChatBot to help you with common questions.

From that, you decide to chat with the Bot and send a message like: "Hi robot, where can I find the product X?"

The ChatBot is able to understand what you want and might answer you in two ways:

> option 1) The ChatBot will send you a big text showing you where the product is (like > an > path), or maybe with a hyperlink to click and navigate on.

<br>
or
<br> 

> option 2) The ChatBot will take you in an interactive way to the website section where the product X is.

**The second option is better, right?**

The image below demonstrate the same scenery which is particularly different then searching a product X, nonetheless, following the same principle:

_Project inspired by the Neo Financial website - cloned._

The user interact with the Chatbot to find information in the site and, consequently, the Chatbot is able to understand the user intentions and redirect the user to correct sections.

In this article, I pretend to share one way to build an Interactive Chatbot that is able to identify user questions and navigate in an interactive way, taking the user to a specific website section (changing the app states) to deliver the desired information with a better user experience.

> Note: This article was inspired by an **innovative idea awarded 2nd place at the Inter Bank Hackathon in 2021**. More details about that Hackathon project are available at: [www.matheusicaro.com/in/projects/talking-to-babi](https://matheusicaro.com/in/projects/talking-to-babi)

The article is going to be split into 5 topics which will be approached in the following sequence:

1. [General view of the project - app integration flow](#general-view-of-the-project---app-integration-flow)
2. [Building the Chatbot conversation flow through Watson Assistant](#building-the-chatbot-conversation-flow-through-watson-assistant)
3. [How does the Front-end work?](#how-does-the-front-end-work)
4. [How does the back-end work?](#how-does-the-back-end-work)
5. [Conclusion and some considerations](#conclusion-and-some-considerations)

In addition, we will use the open-source project: [challenge-interactive-webpage-by-virtual-assistant](https://github.com/matheusicaro/challenge-interactive-webpage-by-virtual-assistant), which was developed as a solution of one personal challenge to test the propose implementation. The webpage was made on cloning of Neo Financial design. _All images and information are copyright of Neo Financial and were taken from the official website - www.neofinancial.com_
