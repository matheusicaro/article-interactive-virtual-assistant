# Virtual Assistant that inte Virtual que interage com o usuario mudando os estados da aplicaÃ§ao Web - como construir um?


Imagine that you are looking for a product "X" (or some specific information) on a random website which your cant find it. 

The website has a ChatBot to help you with common questions.

From that, you decide to chat with the Bot and send a message like: "Hi robot, where can I find the product X?"

The ChatBot is able to understand what you want and might answer you in two ways:

> option 1) The ChatBot will send you a big text showing you where the product is (like > an > path), or maybe with a hyperlink to click and navigate on.
or 
> option 2) The ChatBot will take you in an interactive way to the website section where the product X is.

The second option is better, right?!

In this article, I pretend to share one way to build an Interactive Chatbot that is able to identify user questions and navigate in an interactive way, taking the user to a specific website section (changing the app states) to deliver the desired information with a better user experience.
